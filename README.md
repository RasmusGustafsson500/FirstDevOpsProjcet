This is my first devops project ever, this is a small step in becoming a devops developer

# Project goals:
Build a complete pipeline that:

Gets code from GitHub (Git, version control)

Builds a Docker image of a simple web application (containers)

Pushes the image to a container registry (Azure Container Registry)

Deploys the application to a Kubernetes cluster (AKS) with a Deployment and Service

Implements readiness probe in the deployment configuration (observability)

Automates everything via GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

Uses Terraform or Bicep to create resources in Azure (IaC)

Stores secrets such as ACR login in Azure Key Vault (secrets management)

Writes small PowerShell or Bash scripts to manage parts of the process (automation)
